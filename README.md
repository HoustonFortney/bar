# bar

Putting the bar in foo bar.

This is a static site for drinks I serve at my home bar, served at [bar.houstonfortney.com](https://bar.houstonfortney.com)

It takes a set of drink data, and generates a menu and shopping list for the current menu.

```
pip install -e ./builder
build-menu
cd display && npm start
```
